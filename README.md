Problem Statement
What is Knee osteoarthritis?

Knee osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is typically the result of wear and tear and progressive loss of articular cartilage.

Difficult to understand the above medical terms, right? Let's understand what does osteoarthritis in the knee feel like:

If you have osteoarthritis of the knee, you will probably feel your knee is painful and stiff at times. It may only affect one knee, especially if you've injured it in the past, or you could have it in both. The pain may feel worse at the end of the day, or when you move your knee, and it may improve when you rest.

This is one of those diseases that doctors can't detect until the damage has been done.

About the data
This dataset contains knee X-ray data for both knee joint detection and knee KL grading. The Grade descriptions are as follows:

Grade 0: Healthy knee image.
Grade 1 (Doubtful): Doubtful joint narrowing with possible osteophytic lipping
Grade 2 (Minimal): Definite presence of osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing
Grade 3 (Moderate): Multiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, with mild sclerosis.
Grade 4 (Severe): Large osteophytes, significant joint narrowing, and severe sclerosis.
